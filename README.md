# subnet-info
will return subnet info for an ip/cidr or for the subnet two ips belong to

  Usage:

    ./subnet.pl <ip_address/cidr>

       This will return all subnet info

    ./subnet.pl <ip_address> <ip_address>

       This will compare the IPs, show what subnet they belong to
        and print all info about the subnet

    ./subnet.pl explain <ip_address/cidr>

        This will return all subnet info and
         will also print calculation information
